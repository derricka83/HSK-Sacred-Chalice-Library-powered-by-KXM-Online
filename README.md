## Explanation of Key Directories and Features:

1. #### Backend (/backend/)

**Controllers**: This folder contains the logic for handling requests such as book submissions, user login, and SKU generation.

**Models**: Includes all MongoDB or SQL-based schemas for users, books, SKUs, etc.

**Services**: Handles advanced logic such as AI-powered proofreading, file media compression, SKU assignment, and other business logic.

**Analytics**: Tracks user behavior, including how books are being read, interaction with spiritual debates, and SKU tracking to monitor book performance and engagement.

**Compression**: Contains logic for high-quality automatic media compression, dynamically adjusting size for PDFs, images, MP4s, and other supported file formats.


2. ### Frontend (/frontend/)

**Components**: Organized React components for UI design. This is modular, with each feature (Bookshelf, Library, Forms, Forum) having its own directory.

**Analytics**: Tracks frontend events, such as how often books are opened, time spent reading, and clicks on interactive elements. Useful for monitoring which content is engaging users most.

**Custom Hooks**: Centralized hooks for reusing logic, such as fetching book data, SKU analytics, and media loading.


3. ### AI Integration (/backend/ai/)

- AI-based proofreading for books is implemented here. 
- It tracks grammar, style, and provides suggestions directly in the user interface before books are submitted for admin approval.
- An option to automatically suggest improvements before the book is published.
- Admins have a toggle to bypass AI proofreading and automatically publish books.


4. ### Analytics & SKU Tracking (/backend/analytics/)

- **SKU Assignment**: Each book, media file, or contribution is assigned a unique SKU identifier. 
This SKU is used to track individual books and interactions across the system.
- **Reading Analytics**: Tracks which books are read the most, where users are spending the most time, and even tracks user interaction patterns in the debate and discussion forums.


5. ### Media Compression (/backend/compression/)

**File Compression Engine**: Automatically compresses large media files such as PDFs, MP4s, JPEGs, GIFs, etc., before they are stored or downloaded.

**Wave Files Exclusion:** The system supports all media file types except .wav. Files like PDFs, MP4s, PNGs, JPEGs, and more are optimized for fast loading without compromising quality.


6. ### Libraries Integration (/backend/services/libraries.js)

**Image Libraries**: The system integrates with image services like Unsplash to let authors embed images in their books.

**Video Libraries**: Support for embedding video links from YouTube and other platforms.

**Text Libraries**: Integrates with external text databases for access to additional resources.

**Python Libraries**: For advanced users, Python libraries can be integrated for research, spiritual analytics, or other studies that involve coding.


---

## Additional Features Added:

1. **Advanced Search Portal**:

Allows users to search books using keywords, author name, category, or even full-text search. Includes a filter system for finding books based on format, popularity, and recent contributions.


2. **SKU Analytics Dashboard**:

Admins can view detailed analytics on how specific books are performing using their SKU. This includes engagement metrics, downloads, and comments.



3. **Downloadable Formats** (Paid Feature):

Users will have the ability to download books in PDF or DOC format. This will be a future paid feature, where premium users can access this functionality. The option is available for both public and personal bookshelves.



4. **Media Upload & Compression** (Paid Feature):

The system allows users to upload large media files such as MP4, MP3, PDFs, JPEG, PNG, GIF, and these files are compressed automatically to ensure minimal storage usage without quality loss.



5. **Personalization and Recommendations**:

Uses analytics to recommend books and topics based on user interaction. The system will suggest similar books, upcoming discussions, and spiritual debates to users based on their previous engagements.



6. **Multi-Language Support** (Paid Feature):

Offers multi-language support for users to write and read books in multiple languages. The system supports translations of spiritual texts and contributions.



7. **Forum Analytics** (Paid Feature):

Tracks engagement within the Discussion and Debate Forums, offering insights on popular topics, most engaged users, and trending spiritual discussions.



8. **API Integration** (Paid Feature):

The library includes an open API for developers to integrate external applications with the library, such as importing/exporting book data, fetching analytics, or embedding books on third-party websites.
